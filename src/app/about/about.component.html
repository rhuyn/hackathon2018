        <h1>Why The Need? </h1>

        <p>
          Today in Alberta there are 192 fire detection stations within the forests and only 46 of these interact remotely. These 46 stations don't require
          human interaction and report climate data on an hourly basis. The other stations require a human to manually observe and report climate data. These
          types of stations only report in once or twice per day. Overall this is hugely inefficient system as the technologies of today allow for quicker and more
          accurate detection of fires. We can better manage our human and technical resources to improve fire detection in some of the of the most remote and
          forested areas.

      <h1>Our Solution </h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Together as a group of competitive hackers we have devised a system that will allow the forests to report back to us with little to no human interaction.
          The solution involves a collection of field modules that sense heat and humidity which only need to be placed and activated once. Relying upon
          solar power and a cellular network each of these modules can take active readings and report back their findings. These readings will be in much
          smaller intervals and a much smaller granularity than today's methods.

    <h1>Sacrifices</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        We challenged ourselves to work within some very specific guidelines to produce the most efficient product for this purpose. Each module will be an embedded
        chip and sensors in a waterproof box. In efforts to eliminate as much overhead cost as possible the modules will not be able to track their own location and
        will not involve extranious sensors or cameras. Weights and sizes of these modules will be strictly controlled so they can easily be brought to their deployment
        location and installed.

    <h1>Security</h1>

      <p>
        The program embedded within the modules will be responsible for reporting back if it has been tampered with. This is done by a strict threshold
        of vibration and ongoing monitoring by an onboard vibration sensor. All communication to and from the modules is safe because block chain?

    <h1>Particle Electron</h1>

      <p>
        Our first prototypes utilized the technology present with the particle electron and gave us a preliminary idea of how this system could work.
        However the particle we were working with eventually failed and due to circumstances beyond our control we were unable to recover from this set
        back. At this time we do not have a physical prototype of our field module.

          Our choice to use blockchain technology. The vast array of blockchain technology has yet to be truly uncovered and the only
          definitive way to uncover these uses is to test it and apply it into new technologies and in new environments. We want to be on the leading edge
          of technology and have chosen to utilize and test this technology in our internet of things.
